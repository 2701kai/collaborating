### **Attribute:** In HTML, an attribute is a modifier applied to an HTML element that provides additional information or functionality. It is used to define various characteristics and behaviors of an element. Attributes are specified within the start tag of an element, typically as name-value pairs. They help control the appearance, behavior, and functionality of HTML elements, such as specifying the source of an image, setting the color of a text, or defining the behavior of a link. Attributes play a crucial role in structuring and customizing web content, enabling developers to create dynamic and interactive websites.
