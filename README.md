# Exercise:

Collabs

Instructions:

   Create one repository on GitHub named "collaborating" and add your partner as a collaborator.

   On separate branches, you both should add the following to the readme.
        A short bio of themselves.
        The recipe for your favourite dish.
        The definition of a word.

   Then, both of you make a pull request for your branches and assign the other person.

   Once you have reviewed each other's work, merge the branches to the main.
